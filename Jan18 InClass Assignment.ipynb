    "Define and Compare/Contrast: Temporal/Rate/Latency/Synchronous/Tuning Curves/Population Codes\n",
    "* Temporal Coding involves showing timing of independent spikes or the first of a burst.\n",
    "* Rate Coding involves showing the timing of all the spikes present. \n",
    "* Latency Coding involves showing the timing of when the output was recieved. \n",
    "* Synchronous coding involves showing when the spikes of different trials align with each other.\n",
    "* Tuning curves are a graphical presentation that displays the firing rate of a neuron when displayed with different verisons of a stimulus, such as an orientation of an object.\n",
    "* Population codes are the collective summation of information about a stimulus, such as when different neurons are percieving a line. Multiple neurons will collect different information about the stimulus, and then the sum is the actual perception that is recieved by the brain or information organizing center.  \n"
